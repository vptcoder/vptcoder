## Concept
- High quality programming code (KISS / DRY / SOLID):
   - DRY: https://medium.com/0xcode/dry-dont-repeat-yourself-avoiding-redundancy-in-software-programming-e264ec97276e
   - KISS: https://medium.com/sliitwif/keep-it-simple-stupid-the-kiss-principle-guide-to-developers-d6ad83145955
   - SOLID:

        | **S** | Single Responsibility Principle | A class has one single responsibility and therefore one reason to change (Separation of Concerns). |
        |--|--|--|
        | **O** | Open/Closed Principle | Open for extensions, closed for modifications.
        | **L** | Liskov Substitution Principle | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type. |
        | **I** | Interface Segregation Principle | Have only one interface per client, and only contain within the interface methods the client uses. |
        | **D** | Dependency Inversion Principle | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. | 

- Object Oriented Programming
    - Classes vs Objects vs Interfaces
    - Abstraction, Inheritence, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- Functional Programming
    - Declarative vs Imperative Programming
    - Data Structures and Algorithms
- Software Development Life Cycle

## Technology
- Git
- Scrum
- Agile

##  Behavioural
- responsive and proactive
- adhere to the team standards
- do low-level items without supervision
- do basic problem solving independently (e.g. by using google / youtube / thinking)
- good attitude  
- willingness to learn: **_ask good questions_**, and **_take constructive criticism_** without getting argumentative or taking it personally
