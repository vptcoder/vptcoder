# XUnit

xUnit.Net is an open-source testing framework based on the .NET framework. ‘x’ stands for the programming language, e.g., JUnit, NUnit, etc. The creators of NUnit created xUnit as they wanted to build a better framework rather than adding incremental features to the NUnit framework.

- The popular attributes [SetUp] and [TearDown] are also not a part of the xUnit framework. As per the creators of NUnit (and xUnit), usage of [SetUp] and [TearDown] led to code duplication, and they wanted to implement the same features in a much more optimized manner in xUnit. For initialization, constructor of the test class is used, whereas, for de-initialization, IDisposable interface is used. This also encourages writing much cleaner tests. This makes this C# unit testing framework a much better option when it comes to Selenium automation testing as it is more robust and extensible.

- **xUnit is much more extensible** when compared to NUnit and MSTest. 
    - The [Fact] attribute is used instead of the [Test] attribute. Non-parameterized tests are implemented under the [Fact] attribute, 
    - whereas the [Theory] attribute is used if you plan to use parameterized tests.

- In NUnit and MSTest, the class that contains the tests is under the [TestClass] attribute. This was not a very robust approach hence [TestClass] attribute was also removed in xUnit. Instead, intelligence is built in the xUnit framework so that it can locate the test methods, irrespective of the location of the tests.

Shown below are the most popular attributes/annotations used in the xUnit framework:
| ANNOTATION                     | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Fact]                         | Marks a test method, i.e., actual test in a class                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Assert.Throws Record Exception | Verify the raise and raise assert, irrespective of the place in the code where the problem occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Constructor                    | This is not an attribute but is an ideal replacement for the [SetUp] attribute. The constructor should be parameter-less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IDisposable.Dispose            | This is not an attribute but is an ideal replacement for the [TearDown] attribute. This is where the code for performing necessary cleanup and de-initialization is included.  The decision to do away with [TearDown] was made as the investors of xUnit felt that a lot of unnecessary code was run before every single test execution. |
| [Trait]                        | Used to set arbitrary meta-data on a test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Theory]                       | This attribute is used when data-driven tests have to be executed. In such cases, [Theory] has to be used instead of [Fact] attribute                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [InlineData]                   | This attribute is used along with the [Theory] attribute to supply a subset of data against which parameterized tests will be executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [ClassData]                    | This attribute is used when the parameters being passed to the [Theory] tests are not constants. [Theory] [ClassData(typeof(some-data))]                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [MemberData]                   | This attribute can be used to fetch data for [Theory] from a static method. The most common approach is to load the data from the property of a test class, i.e., using IEnumerable&lt: object[] >                                                                                                                                        |
